# Contributing

We are excited that you are interested in contributing to this project! Thank you for helping us make this project great and being a part of the React Rainbow community. Here are a few guidelines that will help you along the way.

## Create an issue

You can help us improve React Rainbow Components, the first step to begin collaborate is to [Create an Issue](https://github.com/90milesbridge/react-rainbow/issues/new/choose) before submitting a pull request, it's always good to file an issue, so we can discuss the details of your approach or suggestion.

When you create an issue, you will need to select one of these issue types and follow the specific instructions for each type:

1. Bug report (Create a bug report to help us improve React Rainbow Components)
2. Feature request (Suggest an idea for React Rainbow Components)
3. New Component (Suggest a new component idea for React Rainbow Components)

When you write the issue title please follow this convention : `type: [description]`. This issue title follows the same convention of the commit message. See: [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) for a great explanation.

## Submitting a pull request

React Rainbow Components is a community project, so pull requests are always welcome, but, before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it. 
When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per pull request. It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.
As with issues, please begin the title with `type: [ imperative commit message ]`.[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) for a great explanation.

When adding new features or modifying existing ones, please attempt to include all necessary tests to confirm the new behavior.

### Branch Structure

All stable releases are tagged ([view tags](https://github.com/90milesbridge/react-rainbow/tags)).
At any given time, `master` represents the latest development version of the library.
Patches or hotfix releases are prepared on an independent branch.

#### `master` is unsafe

We will do our best to keep `master` in good shape, with tests passing at all times.
